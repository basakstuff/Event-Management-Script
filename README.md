# Event-Management-Script
DB Model

<br> In this system, the events will be organized in different categories. Each category has ID and name.
Each event will be managed by an organizator. Each organizator can login the system via the
username and password and can edit the organization information such as its name, address, charged
personnel, contact information (phone, e-mail). They will create an event and enter the details about it.
These details are event’s category, name, address, county, city, start and end date, price, the quota of
attendees, campaign information (if it is available, the discount rate must be given), description. Also,
the members register the system. In registration step, they will enter name, surname, username,
password, birthdate, e-mail. Firstly, each member is in a “standard” type of membership. After
participation, if a member has paid for 3 events, its membership type changes to “gold” membership
type. The gold members have a 10% discount rate for each event. After registration, they can login the
system with username and password. Member can’t participate any event at the same time. Each
participation sends an invoice to member’s e-mail. The invoice contains the event’s detail (event’s
name, date, location, amount of payment). Also, if the quota is full, nobody will participate.
